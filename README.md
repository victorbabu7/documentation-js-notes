JS learning notes, Parcel Point project documentation and the technologies used.



part 1 : getting started with javacript , react , nexjs 
a. javascript: 
 javaScript is a language programing that can be used on both the server side and client side  in the browser  , of applications.
 i discovered tha to code effectively , i must set up an environement with a coode edito likr visual studio cide and modern browser ,
 for exemple chrome , fire fox , ,, 
 if i want to display a message on use js , , i can use  console.log(); 
 cosole.table() for visualize  structured data , and console.error() to report errows. 
  for exemple : consol.log ("hello victor") or console.table("")
 If i want integrete js on my  html file , a have tow way : 
   a. directly in html file between <script > tags or, what i consider a best pratice , by linking an external javascript file,
   i learnend to use  relative paths to ensure my file are connectly connected .
