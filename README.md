JS learning notes, Parcel Point project documentation and the technologies used.

My name is Victor Babu. This repository is my personal learning journal as I grow from JavaScript beginner to full-stack developer.
I am currently learning JavaScript using a structured book, and I am now on Chapter 12. At the same time, I am working on a real project called ParcelPoint — a smart locker management system built with Next.js, React, Prisma, and Go.
The challenge I faced was simple: the project uses technologies I had not fully learned yet. So I made a plan.
My plan is this:

Learn JavaScript properly from the beginning → understand each concept deeply → then go back to the ParcelPoint project and see exactly how that concept is used in a real application.

Step by step, chapter by chapter, I am building a bridge between what I learn in my book and how it is applied in a professional project. This file documents that entire journey — from the very first JS concept to a full understanding of the ParcelPoint architecture.



part 1 : getting started with javacript , react , nexjs 
a. javascript: 
 javaScript is a language programing that can be used on both the server side and client side  in the browser  , of applications.
 i discovered tha to code effectively , i must set up an environement with a coode edito likr visual studio cide and modern browser ,
 for exemple chrome , fire fox , ,, 
 if i want to display a message on use js , , i can use  console.log(); 
 cosole.table() for visualize  structured data , and console.error() to report errows. 
  for exemple : consol.log ("hello victor") or console.table("")
 If i want integrete js on my  html file , a have tow way : 
   a. directly in html file between <script > tags or, what i consider a best pratice , by linking an external javascript file,
   i learnend to use  relative paths to ensure my file are connectly connected .
